Maybe you’ll take it with you everywhere you go, using it and reusing it and re-re-re-reusing it, with water from kitchen sinks and public drinking fountains and water coolers. Maybe you’ll even become overly attached to your bottle-can, giving it a name like Pablo or Samantha, or something more intimate, like Jake. \nBut then, maybe, sadly, you’ll leave it somewhere, like on your office desk or a dentist’s waiting room, and someone, good intentioned but simple and misguided, will take it and drop it into the recycling bin. Just like that. And maybe as suddenly as this aluminum bottle-can entered your life, it will leave it. And there will be an aluminum bottle-can–shaped void in your world.\nThough you may choose to mourn for Jake, you may be relieved to hear that it takes only 60 days for aluminum bottle-cans to return to the supermarket shelf. So, soon enough, your bottle-can will be right back where you found it in the first place, ready to provide more of the same companionship and service that you’ve come to expect from it. Unless, of course, it’s not there.\nMaybe you’ll be walking down a street you haven’t walked down before and hear the familiar soft, dulcet tones of aluminum clinking against aluminum. And you’ll follow the sound into someone’s back garden, where you will find a set of hanging wind chimes that were once your bottle-can. You’ll feel a surge of relief as you climb atop an Adirondack chair to pull the wind chimes down, even as the owner of the home yells at you to stop. And then a bittersweet goodbye as you drop the wind chimes into a recycling bin, knowing that they'll be born and reborn and re-re-re-re-reborn, experiencing many richly varied lives, before they will, one day, end up ready to perform another tour of duty as your Ever & Ever bottle-can.",

Not to mention the sleepless nights wrought with guilt.",

Which means it’ll always be in use, in some shape or form, never to be caught dead lying around in a landfill or ocean. Second only to reusable water bottles (which we are big, big fans of), it is the perfect disposable water bottle for the office, home, transit, and handbag.\nAluminum chugs along on a beautiful, never-ending path, here long before us, and here long after us. We’re happy to be along for just a tiny stretch of its long and varied journey.",
